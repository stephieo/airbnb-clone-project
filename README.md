# AirBnB Clone Project
## Project Overview
This is a simulation of the robust booking platform, Airbnb. The goal of this clone is real-world functionality and scalability with application security. The backend development will use Django, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, Docker and GitHub Actions for CI/CD 

## Project Goals
- Reproduce core functionality for an MVP
- Master agile team  collaboration in fullstack teams
- Implement security for RESTful amd GraphQL APIs
- Enrich understanding of complex software architectures and database esign
- Design and manage CI/CD pipelines for deployment

## Team Roles
- **Backend Engineer**: creates the API, implements algorithms, business logic and database schemas  using Django and GraphQL
- **QA Engineer**: ensures the application performs according to requirements by running tests on functionality, usability, security and performance
- **DevOps engineer**: Sets up and maintains environments using Docker.Builds and maintains CI/CD pipelines for code releases, faster delivery and maintaining application stability
- **Database Administrator**:  Manages the PostgreSQL database design, indexing and optimization



## Technology Stack
- Django: web framework for building RESTful APIs
- PostgreSQL: a relational database for managing user and property data
- GraphQL: query language useful for large,complex and interrelated data
- Celery: for handling asynchronous tasks
- Redis: a in-memory store for caching and session management
- Docker: containerization tool for creating dev environments
- Github Actions: CI/CD tool for testing and deploying
